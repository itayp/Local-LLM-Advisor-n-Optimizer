/**
 * Settings the UI keeps: the Advanced toggle (product rule 2 — technical
 * columns live behind it, off by default), the purposes picked on
 * Recommend (durable so the new-model watch has something to check
 * against even with nobody looking — build-plan step 10), and the watch's
 * own settings (its master switch and notification mode).
 *
 * Persistence: the daemon's `settings` table is the durable, machine-wide
 * copy (CLAUDE.md: "durable settings go through the daemon's settings
 * table"); localStorage below is a per-viewer cache that makes the first
 * paint snappy and keeps the choices working even when the daemon cannot be
 * reached. On mount this reads GET /api/settings once and, if it answers
 * with real values, those win over whatever localStorage had — the same "a
 * measurement replaces an estimate" shape product rule 4 uses for numbers
 * applies here to which copy is trusted. Every localStorage access is
 * guarded — it can be absent or throw. `initial` (tests only) skips both
 * localStorage and the daemon round trip, so a test's chosen state is
 * never raced by a background fetch.
