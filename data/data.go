// Package data embeds the repo's data files so the daemon ships them inside
// its one binary. The files are the source of truth and stay reviewable as
// YAML; each is read by the package that owns its schema:
//
//	hardware/runtime-support.yaml   internal/hardware (build-plan step 2)
//	catalog/families.yaml           internal/catalog  (build-plan step 4)
//	catalog/external.yaml           internal/catalog/external (build-plan step 9b)
//	catalog/aliases.yaml            internal/catalog/external (build-plan step 9b)
//	hardware/gpus.yaml              internal/estimate (build-plan step 5)
//	bench/suite.yaml, bench/text.txt internal/suite   (build-plan step 6; D-65)
//	recommend/speed-needs.yaml       internal/recommend (backlog item (i), ARCHITECTURE.md D-58)
