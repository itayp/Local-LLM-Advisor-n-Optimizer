// Package backend is the seam between the advisor and the runtimes that
// actually run models. Ollama is the only implementation in the MVP;
// llama.cpp and LM Studio are a second file each later (PRD §18), not a
// rewrite — which is only true if this interface leaks no Ollama
// assumption.
//
// Step 3 completed the interface (Models, Show, Running, Pull, Generate,
// Unload, Install, Start) after reading Ollama's HTTP API (docs/api.md),
// LM Studio's local REST API (v1: /api/v1/models, /models/load,
// /models/unload, /models/download) and its `lms` CLI (ls, get, load, ps,
// unload), and llama-server's API (/props, /v1/models, /slots, and its
// newer --models-dir router mode: /models, /models/load, /models/unload,
// load-on-demand by name). Every method here has a home in all three:
//
//   - Models/Show/Running read an inventory every backend can report in some
//     form (a downloaded-models list; a loaded-models list with sizes).
//   - Pull takes a ModelSource, not a string, because "an Ollama library tag"
//     and "a GGUF file on Hugging Face" are different things to fetch — the
//     seam most likely to leak. llama.cpp has no pull of its own; its
//     implementation (a later file) fetches the GGUF itself and places it in
//     the runtime's models directory.
//   - Generate is deliberately thin (no chat history, tools or images — that
//     is a chat app's job, D-4): the benchmark harness (step 6) is its only
//     caller, and every backend has *some* completion endpoint.
//   - Install and Start are asymmetric by design: what "installed" means
//     differs per backend (an app bundle, a service, a binary someone built
//     themselves), so each implementation decides for itself; the interface
//     only promises that after Install, Detect can (eventually) report
//     installed, and after Start, running.
